	<Say voice="alice">Hello. Please hear my plea. Stop giving detention for failure to show identification. It is a reactionary and unreasonable punishment for such a meaningless crime, especially considering the price of your identification cards. This message will repeat every day, all day, until you give in. Thank you and have a good day. Sincerely, a pissed off senior.</Say>
